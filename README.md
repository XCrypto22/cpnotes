# cpnotes
Easily compile related notes/text data into one file from different text sources

This script helps you organize your text data into some sort of a notebook by constantly checking your 
clipboard for new copied text and automatically paste that text into a txt file which will be saved on your desktop by default.

# Example of the Scenario
Say you are studying a certain topic and you are using different sources like the Internet (eg Wiki) or reading some
PDFs etc... instead of writing down some points manually, Using this script, you can highlight your point and copy the text
using either Ctrl C or right click and copy Then leave the rest to the script.

# Copied Notes/Text About:
- URLs
- Commands
- IP addresses
- History notes etc
- The choice is Yours

# Usage 

run: python3 cpnotes.py

Wait for the script to initialise then choose the name of the file you want to create.

Just minimize the Window (CMD Prompt or Terminal) and let it run in the background
Notice: Everything you copy will appear on the Window just for debugging

# Features
Sleep Mode - you can pause the program to avoid pasting unecessary text by hitting Ctrl-C then resume by entering 'r'.
